# Installation

This page provides basic prerequisites to run OpenVQA, including the setups of hardware, software, and datasets.

## Hardware & Software Setup

A machine with at least **1 GPU (>= 8GB)**, **20GB memory** and **50GB free disk space** is required.  We strongly recommend to use a SSD drive to guarantee high-speed I/O.

The following packages are required to build the project correctly.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.5
- [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) >= 9.0 and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) >= 0.4.1 with CUDA (**Pytorch 1.x is also supported**).
- [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) and initialize the [GloVe](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0/en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0.tar.gz) as follows:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ wget https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0/en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0.tar.gz -O en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0.tar.gz
$ pip install en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0.tar.gz
```

## Dataset Setup

The following datasets should be prepared before running the experiments. 

**Note that if you only want to run experiments on one specific dataset, you can focus on the setup for that and skip the rest.** 

### VQA-v2

 The image features are extracted using the [bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) strategy, with each image being represented as an dynamic number (from 10 to 100) of 2048-D features. We store the features for each image in a `.npz` file. You can prepare the visual features by yourself or download the extracted features from [OneDrive](https://awma1-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yuz_l0_tn/EsfBlbmK1QZFhCOFpr4c5HUBzUV0aH2h1McnPG1jWAxytQ?e=2BZl8O) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1C7jIWgM3hFPv-YXJexItgw#list/path=%2F). The downloaded files contains three files: **train2014.tar.gz, val2014.tar.gz, and test2015.tar.gz**, corresponding to the features of the train/val/test images for *VQA-v2*, respectively. You should place them as follows:

```angular2html
|-- datasets
	|-- coco_extract
	|  |-- train2014.tar.gz
	|  |-- val2014.tar.gz
	|  |-- test2015.tar.gz
```

Besides, we use the VQA samples from the [visual genome dataset](http://visualgenome.org/) to expand the training samples. Similar to existing strategies, we preprocessed the samples by two rules:

1. Select the QA pairs with the corresponding images appear in the MSCOCO train and *val* splits.
2. Select the QA pairs with the answer appear in the processed answer list (occurs more than 8 times in whole *VQA-v2* answers).

For convenience, we provide our processed vg questions and annotations files, you can download them from [OneDrive](https://awma1-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yuz_l0_tn/EmVHVeGdck1IifPczGmXoaMBFiSvsegA6tf_PqxL3HXclw) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QCOtSxJGQA01DnhUg7FFtQ#list/path=%2F), and place them as follow:


```angular2html
|-- datasets
	|-- vqa
	|  |-- VG_questions.json
	|  |-- VG_annotations.json
```

After that, you can run the following script to setup all the needed configurations for the experiments

```bash
$ sh setup.sh
```

Running the script will: 

1. Download the QA files for [VQA-v2](https://visualqa.org/download.html).
2. Unzip the bottom-up features

Finally, the `datasets` folders will have the following structure:

```angular2html
|-- datasets
	|-- coco_extract
	|  |-- train2014
	|  |  |-- COCO_train2014_...jpg.npz
	|  |  |-- ...
	|  |-- val2014
	|  |  |-- COCO_val2014_...jpg.npz
	|  |  |-- ...
	|  |-- test2015
	|  |  |-- COCO_test2015_...jpg.npz
	|  |  |-- ...
	|-- vqa
	|  |-- v2_OpenEnded_mscoco_train2014_questions.json
	|  |-- v2_OpenEnded_mscoco_val2014_questions.json
	|  |-- v2_OpenEnded_mscoco_test2015_questions.json
	|  |-- v2_OpenEnded_mscoco_test-dev2015_questions.json
	|  |-- v2_mscoco_train2014_annotations.json
	|  |-- v2_mscoco_val2014_annotations.json
	|  |-- VG_questions.json
	|  |-- VG_annotations.json

```
